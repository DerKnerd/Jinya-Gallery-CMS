# Jinya Gallery CMS
Jinya Gallery CMS is a Content Management System made for artists. The idea is to give easy ways to add your artworks and organize them in galleries. The whole system is developed by me and my artist friend [Jenny Jinya](http://jenny-jinya.com). Her website is an example of the CMS in action.

# Technologies used
The CMS is based on PHP and Symfony. The backend is developed with Vue.js and a custom CSS framework.

# Deploy
If you want to deploy the Jinya Gallery CMS you only need to download the version you want to install from the [download page](https://files.jinya.de/cms/stable/). It is also possible to install the CMS via Docker.

# Contribute
If you want to contribute just fork the repository and create a pull request.
